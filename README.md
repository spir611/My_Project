TITLE:  The Portuguese Way:  Tui to Santiago

General Content: 
This web page will provide detailed Information relating to the Portuguese Way to Santiago, from Tui to Santiago. 
It will include information on the different stages of the way, maps, important sites to visit along the way, 
tips on how to prepare for the hike, a space for visitors to leave comments about their personal experience, 
links to additional Information and a section where registered hikers can sign up to meet others taking apart 
in the hike during the same period. I have chosen this topic because I deeply enjoy hiking and my experience taking
part in this way has inspired me to create this web page to encourage others to set out on this incredible journey 
and help them make their personal hike a truly positive experience that they will never forget.
